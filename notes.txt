Pick dataset obtained with any two chunking methods applied previously
- Apply embeddings on the chunked datasets using SentenceTransformer

- Applying SentenceTransformer embeddings to text datasets 
prepared using two different chunking methods(character_split, recursive_split) for semantic analysis and comparison.

# Text Chunking & Embedding App A Streamlit app to visualize text chunking (Character/Recursive) and SentenceTransformer embeddings. 
# Features - Two chunking methods 
            - Embedding generation with SentenceTransformer 
            - Frontend with Streamlit ## Run Locally 

✅ Frontend – Streamlit:
I created a Streamlit (app.py) and ran the app locally using Streamlit.

✅ Deployed – Streamlit Cloud:
I attempted deployment on Streamlit Cloud using a custom app name and repository setup.

✅ Version Control – GitHub:
I created a GitHub repository CHINNAKOTLAJAGANNATH/Embedding_app_Day6_GenAI, initialized Git locally, committed files, and pushed code (with minor conflicts resolved).
